# Gameplay

## Player

• FIXME: Link hasn’t two hitboxes, the collision matrix contains the movement vector (vx;vy)
   → That's why we need to test his direction
   → That's why the two hitboxes had close values

## NPCs

• WIP: Add `NPC`s
   → Create a class `Message` or `NPCMessage` which could contain actions,
     conditions, etc.
      ▸ Improve `MessageBox` to handle choices
   → Check the real hitbox of Link thanks to `NPC`s which don't have rounded
     corners
      ▸ Write a `MapCollisionHandler`
   → Fix remaining issues
      ▸ Fix the conflict between button A's action and `NPC`'s dialog
      ▸ Link can be displayed behind and in front of a `NPC` in the original game
         → FIXME: I think I'll need two sets of `SceneObjects`, the ones in front of the player, the others behind
         → Or maybe just using z-buffer...? T.T
      ▸ `NPC` animation should be stopped when his message is displayed
         → I think using `Sprite::pause` could be a good idea

## Weapons

• TODO: Power bracelet
   ◦ DONE: Pull state is not animated
   ◦ TODO: Can grab without pushing state
   ◦ TODO: Pulling is only possible from the opposite direction
   ◦ TODO: If link pulls too hard, he’ll be exhausted for a bit
• TODO: Improve sword positions
• TODO: Remove sword loading animation and replace it by palette switch

## Monsters

• WIP: `Octorok` should drop collectables
   → FIXME: Drop after the end of the death animation
• TODO: Implement projectiles for `Octoroks`
   ◦ TODO: Player can cancel them with a simple sword slash

## Collectables

• TODO: Improve `Collectable` drop movement and add shadow

                                     * * *

# Old todo

## Refactoring issues

• FIXME: Fix grass objects hitbox
• FIXME: Fix player/button collision when using sword
   → Link shouldn’t move, the `Sprite` should (check the original game)
• FIXME: `Sword` position when player is hurt at the same time he uses it is weird
   → Slow down game to see what actually happens
• FIXME: `HurtMovement` can stop if player is stopped?
   ▸ Check the behaviour in the original game
   → Check `isMoving` flag
• FIXME: The tile under link should be destroyed by his spin attack
• FIXME: Find a better way to check if the player is facing a chest

## Other issues

• FIXME: When `Octorok` goes out of the map it throws an exception
   → “Fatal error at ResourceHandler.hpp:43: Unable to find resource with name: 2-0-1”
   → Why the `ScrollingTransition` is triggered with an `Octorok`
• FIXME: `Player` and `Octoroks` can be pushed out of the map during `HurtMovement`
   → Check in `PlayerFactory::mapCollisions`, if hurt so go to `ScrollingTransition`, else
     block him
• FIXME: Octorok's `HurtMovement` speed too slow?
   → Check the original game, and adapt the speed
• FIXME: Improve palette system
   → Look at `KubKraft` and improve `Shader` class
   → Move palette system into other files
• FIXME: `Rupees` are added one by one to the counter in the original game
   ▪ There's also a sound effect
• FIXME: Check sound effect channels in real game
   ▪ For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when link releases spin attack?
   ▪ It's not possible to hear text ‘clicks’ during ‘tadaaaaaaa’ (new item)
   → Define channel in constructor (and ‘load’), so from `Sound.cpp`
• FIXME: Fix `grassDestroy` animation
   → Find the *Oracle of* version
• FIXME: `Player` can be teleported when hurt
   → Check if player is hurt before teleportation
• FIXME: Find why collectables don't drop correctly on my eeePC

## Todo after engine is finished

• TODO: Improve game for `OpenGL ES` and try on Android
• TODO: Write a little game editor with `Qt` to add content if needed, it needs:
   ▪ TODO: `Map` editor
   ▪ TODO: `SceneObject` editor
